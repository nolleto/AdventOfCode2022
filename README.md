# AdventOfCode2022

In this repo contain all solutions (WIP) of [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Running the solutions

All the solutions will be on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and you can execute each by executing `ruby ./day_[number_of_the_day]/main.rb`

Sample:

```cmd
ruby ./day_1/main.rb
ruby ./day_2/main.rb
# ...
```

### Testing

I added some tests using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/). To run them you can run in your terminal:

```cmd
rspec
```

or
```cmd
rspec --format doc
```

To see all tests scenarios and descriptions.
